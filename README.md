Theoretical Mechanisms Specification

To turn raw simulation code into meaningful insights, we need a complete theoretical foundation detailing every process, feedback loop, and interaction. This document will serve as the master blueprint.

1. Core Metrics & Definitions

Symbol

Name

Interpretation & Units

Ψ

Psionic Potential

Belief‐energy reservoir (p‑units)

C

Convergence Momentum

Narrative alignment pressure (dimensionless)

S

Stability

Systemic resilience (0–1 scale)

R

Reserves

Resource buffer (R‑units)

P

Panic

Crisis level (0–∞, capped 10 by default)

2. Process Equations & Feedback Loops

Psionic Flux Update



Drift rate d controls leak.

Ritual input and phi‑coupling supply new belief­energy.

Stability Update



Ensures environmental wear & maintenance trade‑off.

Reserves Update



Consumption E vs. deposit D.

Convergence Update



Combines psionic drive, instability pressure, and story‑burn rate.

Panic Update



Balances rising dissonance, shocks, and ordering forces.

3. Secondary Modules & Interactions

NodeAnchor Bleed: Anchors leak EFS per linear/exponential/stochastic modes.

Energy Taxonomy Interplay: Mapping Ψ‑CCI‑DF‑…‑CM within each beat.

Economic Feedback: M, Q, T, π, Iₚ loops drive ‘value’ genesis.

Goods Validation: Quality multiplier and rejection logic tie back to Ψ, C, S, AS.

Faction Tensions: Directed edges modulating thresholds, causing cross‑impact.

4. Narrative Trigger Logic

Define exact conditions for each S‑code (S‑01 through S‑14), e.g.:

S‑01 (Unity Broadcast): Ψ_t > θ₁ and CCI_t < θ₂ → global cohesion event.

…etc.

5. Integration & Execution Flow

Load Manifest → parse all parameters, thresholds, multipliers.

Initialize State → set Ψ, C, S, R, P, Node EFS, faction stores.

Beat Loop:

Compute updates for metrics (steps 1–5).

Apply NodeAnchor bleeds.

Validate goods, update economy.

Evaluate Story‑trigger conditions.

Run inconsistency checks.

Log & Visualize → history, QA events, dashboard.

Next Steps

Review and flesh out Narrative Trigger Logic for all S‑codes.

Confirm parameter ranges (θ₁, θ₂, etc.) and units.

Map missing interactions: e.g., BFR, OR, ER influences on core updates.

Lock down execution flow ordering and concurrency guarantees.



6. Player Engine Integration

Treat the human player as a distinct subsystem whose discrete actions each tick emit events that drive the core sim variables. This unifies player, NPC, and environmental influences under the same delta-based update loop.

6.1 Define Player Actions & Output Events

Action

Story Effect

Output Event

Investigate Ruins

Seek lore → ups Symbolic Potency (SP)

{type:"investigate", potency:2}

Rally the Guards

Align factions → ups C (Convergence)

{type:"rally", potency:1}

Sabotage the Ward

Undermine order → downs S (Stability)

{type:"sabotage", potency:3}

Appeal to Nobles

Shift will → ups C & Ψ

{type:"appeal", potency:2}

Retreat / Hide

Avoid conflict → downs P (Panic)

{type:"hide", potency:2}

6.2 Simulation Tick with Player Events

Incorporate external_events from the Player Engine before running the feedback loop:

def simulation_tick(state, external_events):
    # 1. NPC/environment updates
    state = update_from_npcs_and_environment(state)
    # 2. Player actions
    for evt in external_events:
        state = apply_player_event(state, evt)
    # 3. Core feedback loops
    state = feedback_loop_step(state)
    return state

6.3 apply_player_event

Translate player events into variable deltas:

def apply_player_event(state, evt):
    if evt['type']=='investigate':
        state['SP'] += evt['potency'] * state.get('knowledge_factor',1)
    elif evt['type']=='rally':
        state['C']  += evt['potency'] * state.get('faction_cohesion',1)
    elif evt['type']=='sabotage':
        state['S']  -= evt['potency'] * state.get('ward_strength',1)
    elif evt['type']=='appeal':
        state['C']   += evt['potency']*0.5
        state['psi'] += evt['potency']*0.5
    elif evt['type']=='hide':
        state['P']  -= evt['potency']*0.7
    return state

Tune the multipliers so that player influence is visible but balanced against autonomous forces.

6.4 Balancing & Feedback

Action Budget: Limit total potency per tick or introduce resource costs (e.g. Stamina) to prevent spamming.

Contextual Availability: Only offer actions when state thresholds or story triggers allow.

UI Projections: Display projected deltas next to each choice: “Investigate → +2 SP, +0.5 AS.”

Cooldowns & Costs: Assign cooldown periods or currency costs to high-impact actions.

6.5 Example Turn Flow

Render State: Show current C, Ψ, S, R, P, SP, AS, etc.

List Actions: Contextual menu of player actions with projected impacts.

Player Chooses: Emit selected event.

Run Tick: simulation_tick(state, [event]).

Narrative Feedback: Generate a text beat: “Your sabotage cracked the ward—stability falls by 3.”



7. Meta-Architectural Rigor & Directive Enforcement

Our simulation’s architecture mirrors a hyper-structured, pattern-driven cognition—ensuring that every input, module, and output is rigorously filtered, tagged, and self-validated:

Directive Adherence Core: The first-pass gate through which all user inputs, player events, and external data must pass. It enforces the primary mission statements and blocks any unaligned signals before further processing.

Specialized Engine Cascade: Subsequent layers (Φ‑Density, CCI, DASH, PDS‑1, Manifestation, etc.) each operate on pre‑validated inputs, preventing unsanctioned “jumps” or emergent drift.

Pattern-Integrity Enforcer: Continuously scans lexical and semantic coherence across narrative and code modules, flagging any deviations from defined schemas.

Recursive Conflict Resolver: On detecting ambivalent or contradictory states, it interjects with FreezeExceptions or corrective adjustments—maintaining internal logical consistency.

Meta-Awareness Monitor: Aggregates health metrics from all sub-engines and surfaces meta‑insights (e.g., rising paradox rates, over-indexed anomaly stress), guiding high‑level interventions.

This layered, self‑monitoring structure guarantees that simulation outputs are not random noise but the result of a meticulously calibrated cascade of checks and balances.
